\usage{
add_process_code(
  table,
  name_column = "process_name",
  code_column = "process_code"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{table}{The table that will be modified with a new column.}

\item{name_column}{The name of the column in \code{table} containing the names.}

\item{code_column}{The name of the output column containing the codes.}
}
\value{
A tibble with all the contents of \code{table} and an extra column
named \code{code_column}, which contains the codes. If there is no code match,
an \code{NA} is included.

\examples{
table <- tibble::tibble(
  process_name = c("Beans production", "Olive Oil extraction", "Dummy")
)
add_process_code(table)

table |>
  dplyr::rename(my_process_name = process_name) |>
  add_process_code(name_column = "my_process_name")

add_process_code(table, code_column = "my_custom_code")
