\title{Convert Fresh Matter (FM) to Dry Matter (DM) and finally to Nitrogen (N) ---
Define a list of special items that require using the primary biomass name
for selecting conversion coefficients
Add a column to choose the appropriate biomass name for matching
conversion factors
Join with FM to DM conversion factors using Biomass_match, then calculate
Dry Matter production
Join with DM to N conversion factors using Biomass_match, then calculate
Nitrogen production
Remove intermediate columns and rename Biomass_match to Name_biomass
Summarize total Dry Matter and Nitrogen production per Item, Year,
Province, and Box}
