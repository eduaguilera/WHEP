This code is creating a dataset, based on N production data of crops and livestock, which represents
the following destinies: food, feed, other uses, exports, imports. This is the base of the GRAFS model.
The dataset contains data in MgN for each year, province, item, and box (cropland, semi natural agroecosystems,

This is the base of the GRAFS model.
The dataset contains data in MgN for each year, province, item, and box
(cropland, semi natural agroecosystems,
livestock, fish, additives). Processed items, residues, woody crops,
and grazed weeds are taken into account.
Seeds were subtracted from crop production.
