\title{Crop residue items}
\usage{
get_primary_residues(file_path)
}
\arguments{
\item{file_path}{The local path where the input CSV is located. It is
recommended to use an autogenerated path by \code{get_file_path()} function.}
}
\value{
A tibble with the crop residue data.
It contains the following columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{year}: The year in which the recorded event occurred.
\item \code{area_code}: FAOSTAT internal code for each country from where the data
is from. Equivalences with ISO 3166-1 numeric can be found in the
\emph{Area Codes} CSV from the zip file that can be downloaded from
\href{https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/FBS}{FAOSTAT}. TODO: Think about
this, would be nice to use ISO3 codes but won't be enough for our periods
\item \code{item_prod_code}: FAOSTAT internal code for each production item. This is
the crop that is generating the residue.
\item \code{item_cbs_code}: FAOSTAT internal code for each commodity balance sheet
item. This is the obtained residue. In the commodity balance sheet,
this can be three different items right now:
\itemize{
\item \code{2105}: \code{Straw}
\item \code{2106}: \verb{Other crop residues}
\item \code{2107}: \code{Firewood}
}

These are actually not FAOSTAT defined items, but custom defined by us.
When necessary, FAOSTAT codes are extended for our needs.
\item \code{value}: The amount of residue produced, measured in tonnes.
}
