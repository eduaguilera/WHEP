\usage{
get_bilateral_trade(file_path)
}
\arguments{
\item{file_path}{The local path where the input CSV is located}
}
\value{
A tibble with the reported trade between countries.
It contains the following columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{year}: The year when the data was collected.
\item \code{from_code}: FAOSTAT internal code for the country that is exporting the
item. Equivalences with ISO 3166-1 numeric can be found in the
\emph{Area Codes} CSV from the zip file that can be downloaded from
\href{https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/FBS}{FAOSTAT}. TODO: Think about
this, would be nice to use ISO3 codes but won't be enough for our periods
\item \code{to_code}: FAOSTAT internal code for the country that is importing the
item. See previous \code{from_code}.
\item \code{item}: Natural language name for the item that is being traded.
\item \code{unit}: Measure unit for the traded item. It can have two values:
\itemize{
\item \code{"tonnes"}: Trade amount in tonnes (for crop items)
\item \code{"heads"}: Trade amount in number of animals (for livestock items)
}
\item \code{value}: The amount traded in the corresponding measure unit.
}

For the final data obtained, the export data was preferred, i.e.,
if country \code{"A"} says it exported \code{X} tonnes to country \code{"B"} but country
\code{"B"} claims they got \code{Y} tonnes from country \code{"A"}, we trust the export data
\code{X}. This choice is only needed if there exists a reported amount from both
sides. Otherwise, the single existing report is chosen.

For each item and year, the total exports should match the total imports.
TODO: Balance data for this to be true.

\description{
Clean CSV data from the given \code{file_path}. It is recommended to use an
autogenerated path by \code{get_file_path()} function.
