\usage{
get_primary_production(file_path)
}
\arguments{
\item{file_path}{The local path where the input CSV is located. It is
recommended to use an autogenerated path by \code{get_file_path()} function.}
}
\value{
A tibble with the item production data.
It contains the following columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{year}: The year in which the recorded event occurred.
\item \code{area_code}: FAOSTAT internal code for each country from where the data
is from. Equivalences with ISO 3166-1 numeric can be found in the
\emph{Area Codes} CSV from the zip file that can be downloaded from
\href{https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/FBS}{FAOSTAT}. TODO: Think about
this, would be nice to use ISO3 codes but won't be enough for our periods
\item \code{item_prod_code}: FAOSTAT internal code for each produced item.
\item \code{item_cbs_code}: FAOSTAT internal code for each commodity balance sheet
item. The commodity balance sheet contains an aggregated version of
production items. This field is the code for the corresponding
aggregated item.
\item \code{live_anim_code}: Commodity balance sheet code for the type of livestock
that produces the livestock product. It can be:
\itemize{
\item \code{NA}: The entry is not a livestock product.
\item Non-\code{NA}: The code for the livestock type. The name can also be
retrieved by using \code{add_item_cbs_name()}.
}
\item \code{unit}: Measurement unit for the data. Here, keep in mind three groups of
items: crops (e.g. \verb{Apples and products}, \code{Beans}...), livestock (e.g.
\verb{Cattle, dairy}, \code{Goats}...) and livestock products (e.g. \verb{Poultry Meat}, \verb{Offals, Edible}...). Then the unit can be one of:
\itemize{
\item \code{tonnes}: Available for crops and livestock products.
\item \code{ha}: Hectares, available for crops.
\item \code{t_ha}: Tonnes per hectare, available for crops.
\item \code{heads}: Number of animals, available for livestock.
\item \code{LU}: Standard Livestock Unit measure, available for livestock.
\item \code{t_head}: tonnes per head, available for livestock products.
\item \code{t_LU}: tonnes per Livestock Unit, available for livestock products.
}
\item \code{value}: The amount of item produced, measured in \code{unit}.
}
