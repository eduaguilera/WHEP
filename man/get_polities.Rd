\title{Commodity balance sheet data}
\usage{
get_polities()
}
\arguments{
\item{file_path}{The local path where the input CSV is located. It is
recommended to use an autogenerated path by \code{get_file_path()} function.}
}
\value{
A tibble with the commodity balance sheet data in wide format.
It contains the following columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{year}: The year in which the recorded event occurred.
\item \code{area}: The name of the country where the data is from.
\item \code{area_code}: FAOSTAT internal code for each country. Equivalences
with ISO 3166-1 numeric can be found in the \emph{Area Codes} CSV from the
zip file that can be downloaded from
\href{https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/FBS}{FAOSTAT}. TODO: Think about
this, would be nice to use ISO3 codes but won't be enough for our periods
\item \code{item}: Natural language name for the item.
\item \code{item_code}: FAOSTAT internal code for each item.
}

The other columns are quantities (measured in tonnes), where total supply
and total use should be balanced.

For supply:
\itemize{
\item \code{production}: Produced locally.
\item \code{import}: Obtained from importing from other countries.
\item \code{stock_retrieval}: Available as net stock from previous years. For ease,
only one stock column is included here as supply. If the value is
positive, there is a stock quantity available as supply. Otherwise, it
means a larger quantity was stored for later years and cannot be used as
supply, having to deduce it from total supply. Since in this case it is
negative, the total supply is still computed as the sum of all of these.
}

For use:
\itemize{
\item \code{food}: Food for humans.
\item \code{feed}: Food for animals.
\item \code{export}: Released as export for other countries.
\item \code{seed}: Intended for new production.
\item \code{processing}: The product will be used to obtain other subproducts.
\item \code{other_uses}: Any other use not included in the above ones.
}

There is an additional column \code{domestic_supply} which is computed as the
total use excluding \code{export}.
