\usage{
get_polities()
}
\value{
A tibble with the polities data in wide format containing the following columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{polity_code}: WHEP internal code for each polity (may be NA for some records).
\item \code{polity_name}: Standardized polity name used across the WHEP project.
\item \code{polity_name_full}: Full original polity name for reference purposes.
\item \code{polity_code_full}: Extended polity code when available (may be NA).
\item \code{polity_name_FAO}: FAO standardized name for the polity when available.
\item \code{polity_name_FT}: Federico-Tena standardized polity name (NA for WHEP-only records).
\item \code{polity_name_source}: Source attribution indicating data origin ("WHEP" or "FT").
\item \code{polity_code_source}: Code system source attribution ("WHEP" or "FT").
\item \code{start_year}: Starting year for the trading polity period (from Federico-Tena data).
\item \code{end_year}: Ending year for the trading polity period (from Federico-Tena data).
\item \verb{Comments FT}: Notes and comments from Federico-Tena dataset.
}

The function applies the following name standardization rules to Federico-Tena data. These are some examples:
\itemize{
\item "United States" → "United States of America"
\item "Australia Commonwealth" → "Australia"
\item "Cameroon (Kamerun)" → "Cameroon"
\item "Ceylon (Sri Lanka)" → "Sri Lanka"
\item "Guinea Bisau (Portuguese Guinea)" → "Guinea-Bissau"
\item "Wallis and Futuna Island" → "Wallis and Futuna Islands"
\item "Western Samoa" → "American Samoa"
\item "Morocco (French)" → "Morocco"
\item All other names remain unchanged
}
}
\description{
Combines polities data from two sources to create a unified dataset while
maintaining data integrity and applying specific transformation rules. This
function integrates data from the WHEP-polities sheet in Codes_coefs.xlsx and the Federico-Tena
dataset to produce a harmonized polities dataset for the project.

The integration process ensures consistency across both data sources and
applies standardized transformation protocols including manual name
standardization and proper source attribution.
}
\details{
The function performs the following operations:
\enumerate{
\item Reads and preprocesses Federico-Tena data with standardized column mapping
\item Applies manual name corrections to align with WHEP/FAO standards
\item Loads WHEP-polities data and ensures proper source labeling
\item Identifies new records from Federico-Tena not present in WHEP data
\item Standardizes column structure across both datasets
\item Combines datasets vertically while maintaining data integrity
\item Applies final cleaning rules for consistent source attribution
}

Data sources:
\itemize{
\item WHEP-polities sheet from the WHEP project database
\item Federico-Tena trading polities dataset with temporal coverage
}

The resulting dataset provides comprehensive polity information suitable for
historical production and trade analysis with proper source attribution and
standardized naming conventions.
