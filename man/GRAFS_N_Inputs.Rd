\title{n Inputs, Production and nue in Spain}
\value{
The output (n_inputs_combined) contains data on n in MgN for the columns
MgN_dep,  MgN_fix, MgN_syn, MgN_manure, MgN_urban, Prod_MgN
for each Year, Province and Box (Cropland, semi_natural_agroecosystems,
Livestock, Fish, Additives).
As a base, data from the files n_balance_ygpit_all.rds and
GRAFS_Prod_Destiny.csv were used.
The data are assigned to items. For this purpose, definitions in
Name_biomasses were assigned to items with the
file Codes_coefs.xlsx (sheet = Names_biomass_CB).
Manure was calculated by the sum of Excreta, Solid, and Liquid from the
file n_balance_ygpit_all.rds.
n production was calculated with data from the
file GRAFS_Prod_Destiny.csv with the following formula:
(Prod_MgN = (Food + Feed + Other_uses + Export) - Import)
nitrogen use efficiency (nue) for Cropland and
semi_natural_agroecosystems was calculated by the sum of Inputs
with the following formula: (nue = (Prod_MgN / Inputs_MgN) * 100)
}
\description{
This code is creating a dataset with nitrogen (n) inputs (deposition,
fixation, synthetic, urban, manure)
and n production in Spain between 1860 and 2020 for the GRAFS model on a
provincial level
