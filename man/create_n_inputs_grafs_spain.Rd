\title{N Inputs, Production and NUE in Spain}
\usage{
create_n_inputs_grafs_spain()
}
\value{
The output (N_Inputs_combined) contains data on N in MgN for the columns MgN_dep,  MgN_fix, MgN_syn, MgN_manure, MgN_urban, Prod_MgN
for each Year, Province and Box (Cropland, Semi_natural_agroecosystems, Livestock, Fish, Additives).
As a base, data from the files N_balance_ygpit_all.rds and GRAFS_Prod_Destiny.csv were used.
The data are assigned to Items. For this purpose, definitions in Name_biomasses were assigned to Items with the file Codes_coefs.xlsx (sheet = Names_biomass_CB).
Manure was calculated by the sum of Excreta, Solid, and Liquid from the file N_balance_ygpit_all.rds.
N production was calculated with data from the file GRAFS_Prod_Destiny.csv withe the following formula: (Prod_MgN = (Food + Feed + Other_uses + Export) - Import)
Nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) for Cropland and Semi_natural_agroecosystems was calculated by the sum of Inputs with the following formula: (NUE = (Prod_MgN / Inputs_MgN) * 100)
}
\description{
This code is creating a dataset with nitrogen (N) inputs (deposition, fixation, synthetic, urban, manure)
and N production in Spain between 1860 and 2020 for the GRAFS model on a provincial level
