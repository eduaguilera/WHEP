Prepare LU coefficients with Livestock_cat mapping
Merge livestock data with LU coefficients and calculate totals
Aggregate LU_total per Year, Province
Aggregate Area
Calculate livestock density
Calculate cropland productivity
Aggregate feed from semi natural agroecosystems
Aggregate feed from cropland
Calculate feed share (semi_natural feed / total feed)
Use feed supply from GRAFS_Prod_Destiny_git + LU data
Calculate feed import per province based on national imports & LU shares
Calculate imported feed share at province level
Assign Typologies + map
Return the relevant map_years}
